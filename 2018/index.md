**Deep Learning Camp Jeju**
is an annual camp held at [Jeju Island, South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Island),
which was [first launched in 2017](../2017/) with 20 participants from all over the world.

## Why should I apply?

- You will have one whole month at Jeju to focus on a deep learning based project, surrounded with top class fellow researchers/developers
- You will be team up with wonderful mentors, that will help you progress your project
- You will be provided full accommodation support, 1000 USD stipend, and up to 300 USD support for flights to Jeju
- You will be also provided 1000 USD worth of Google Cloud credits

## How does this work?

- All applicants will suggest a research topic, which will be reviewed and selected by mentors and organizers
    ([See topics from 2017](https://github.com/TensorFlowKR/mlcampjeju/blob/master/2017/github/04_FinalPresentation.md))
- Each participant will work on the topic for one month pre-camp, with support from a mentor
- Each participant will work on the topic for one month on-site, at Jeju
- At the end of the camp, each participant will be expected to release project results as follows:
    1. Present final results at presentation day of the camp
    1. Release code implemented in TensorFlow as open source on GitHub
    1. Upload one technical paper of at least 3 pages uploaded to arXiv
- Last but not least, have fun!!!

## Why Jeju?

- No visa is required for most international visitors to stay up to 30 days
- Jeju is a beautiful island, frequently referred to as the "Hawaii" in Asia

# FAQ

1. Can I propose more than one project?
    - Sure! Just include both topics in your application.
1. Can I apply as a team?
    - We value teamwork, but are currently seeking for individual participants.
1. Can I join the camp with my own money if my proposal is not selected?
    - No, becuase we have limited space, but you may consider applying to the Deep learning summer school and/or hackathon which will have separate application processes.
1. Will datasets be provided?
    - No, the participant should prepare their own datasets.
1. Can we just implement previously existing models, or should we have new ideas?
    - It's okay to just do an implemention of a model, but it is definitely preferred to have an idea to improve that model, or build a real-life application using it.
1. Am I allowed to bring a partner?
    - Unfortunately we only provide accommodations for the participants. You can book your own accommodations if you wish to stay with your partner during the camp.
1. Are there restrictions to licenses of the to-be-released open source code?
    - An MIT licence is recommended, but can be changed with your mentor's consent.
1. Are there restrictions to authorship of the to-be-released technical paper?
    - The paper should include you and your mentor, but can be extended with your mentor's consent.
1. How does the mentoring work?
    - Most mentors are machine learning and/or deep learning experts, that have a full-time job. This means they will not be on-site most of the time, but are very enthusiatic to help you out! So please actively ask questions and start discussions with them.
