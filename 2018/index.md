**Deep Learning Camp Jeju**
is an annual camp held at [Jeju Island, South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Island),
which was [first launched in 2017](../2017/) with 20 participants from all over the world.

This year, it will be expanded to hosting 30 participants,
that come from various backgrounds but all interested in practicing and advancing deep learning.

## How does this work?

- All applicants will suggest a research topic, which will be reviewed and selected by mentors and organizers
    ([See topics from 2017](https://github.com/TensorFlowKR/mlcampjeju/blob/master/2017/github/04_FinalPresentation.md))
- Each participant will work on the topic for one month pre-camp, with support from a mentor
- Each participant will work on the topic for one month on-site, at Jeju

# FAQ

1. Can I propose more than one project?
    - Sure! Just include both topics in your application.
1. Can I apply as a team?
    - We value teamwork, but are currently seeking for individual participants.
1. Can I join the camp with my own money if my proposal is not selected?
    - No, becuase we have limited space, but you may consider applying to the Deep learning summer school and/or hackathon which will have separate application processes.
1. Will datasets be provided?
    - No, the participant should prepare their own datasets.
1. Can we just implement previously existing models, or should we have new ideas?
    - It's okay to just do an implemention of a model, but it is definitely preferred to have an idea to improve that model, or build a real-life application using that model.
1. Am I allowed to bring a parter?
    - Unfortunately we only provide accommodations for the participants. You can book your own accommodations if you wish to stay with your partner during the camp.
1. Are there restrictions to licenses of the to-be-released open source code?
    - An MIT licence is recommended, but can be changed with your mentor's consent.
1. Are there restrictions to authorship of the to-be-released technical paper?
    - The paper should include you and your mentor, but can be extended with your mentor's consent.
